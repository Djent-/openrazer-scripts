# openrazer-scripts

## reactive_click.py
Works with: Firefly, Deathadder (probably most mice)

Effect: On left and right click, the mousepad and mouse have a reactive light effect. On scroll, one half of each device will have a reactive light effect. The colors are random each time - ie. everything will be the same random color.

Bugs: The script occassionally stops working, starts flashing rapidly, and then starts working normally again. This is due to lol python threading. Don't thread on me!

## razer_spectrum_sync.py
Works with: Firefly, Deathadder (probably all mice), probably other devices

Effect: Synchronizes the start of the spectrum glow.
